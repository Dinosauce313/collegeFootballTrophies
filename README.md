### A Look at College Football Rivalry Trophies

With the first American college football game being played in 1869 between the New Jersey (now Princeton) Tigers and Rutgers Queensmen (now Scarlet Knights), the sport has grown deep roots in the hearts of sports fans all over the world. Between various teams and regions of the country are pockets of subcultures, each revering their own players, team histories, and traditions. Over time, much about the sport has changed. Various rules and safety precautions have been adjusted to make the game safer and more dynamic. Many schools began to form their own athletic conferences to make managing scheduling games, recruiting players, and drawing in revenue easier. Furthermore, college football has seen many American cultural icons line up on the gridiron, whether as a player or coach. Some of these names include former U.S. president Gerald Ford,  Knute Rockne, O.J. Simpson, and Herschel Walker. However, one everlasting facet of the sport are the various rivalries between schools. In fact, that Rutgers-New Jersey game is considered today as a beginning of college football rivalries, and the losing New Jersey players were run out of town (literally) by Rutgers students. Ever since then, many more schools in the name of friendly competition or bad blood have eagerly competed against one another on the field, oftentimes with the winning team receiving or keeping a trophy upon victory. Lots of these rivalries abnd trophies have a deep history, and the purpose of my webpage is to give background information on some of them.

### The Little Brown Jug

The Little Brown Jug is a trophy given to the winner of football games between the University of Michigan and the University of Minnesota. The Michigan-Minnesota rivalry is one of the oldest college football rivalries in existence, starting in 1892. In 1903, when the Michigan football team came to Minneapolis to play, Michigan head coach Fielding Yost told a student manager to buy something to carry water, afraid that Minnesota fans would contaminate the water supply. The team purchased a 5-gallon jug for 30 cents. Although the game finished in a 6-6 tie, it was still a win in the eyes of Minnesota fans. After the game, a custodian brought the jug to the head of the Minnesota athletics department, declaring that Yost had left his jug. It is uncertain as to how the jug was left in Minnesota. Some accounts say that the jug was stolen. The more commonly believed explanation is that Yost had forgotten about the jug. In 1956, a written passage said that Yost simply felt that the jug had served its purpose, and therefore left it behind. Regardless of how the jug remained there, the Minnesota custodian and athletics head were both excited to own it. They painted the jug brown (it is currently half painted brown and blue, Minnesota and Michigan's respective colors) and wrote "Michigan Jug - Captured by Oscar, October 31st, 1903" on the side alongside with the score "Michigan 6, Minnesota 6". In 1909, both teams agreed to play for ownership of the jug, and the jug became the traveling trophy it is today. 

### The Stanford Axe

The Stanford Axe is a trophy awarded to the winner of football games between Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley. The Axe was first seen on April 13, 1899 when Stanford yell leaders used it to decapitate a straw man dressed in blue and gold ribbons. Two days later, the Axe was used to cut blue and gold ribbon after every good play by the Stanford baseball team. Stanford did lose the game and series to Cal, and yell leaders were debating if the Axe was actually a jinx. As this discussion was taking place, Cal students stole the Axe and ran off with it. A chase happened through San Francisco as Berkeley students passed the Axe around, with Stanford fans and San Francisco police rushing after them. The Axe's handle was broken during this commotion. Clint Miller, a Cal student,  was able to hide the axe head under his thick overcoat. After posing as a couple with an old girlfriend, Miller was able to board a ferry to Alameda/Oakland. The Axe was sent to Berkeley where it was held by a fraternity and later a bank vault. For 31 years, Berkeley maintained possession of the Axe. However, in 1930, 21 Stanford students aimed to steal the Axe back. They were dubbed the Immortal 21 in Stanford lore, as well as the Immoral 21 in Berkeley history. Being able to get to the Axe would be difficult; it was kept in a bank vault and only taken out in an armored vehicle for spring baseball and football rallies. After a spring Axe rally, the Stanford students blinded the Grand Custodian of the Axe with camera flash. Others started a scuffle to take possession of the Axe, then tear gas or a smoke bomb was used to dispel Cal students who guarded it. The Axe was taken to one of three cars that each sped off in 3 different directions. Other Stanford students delayed search efforts by giving wrong leads. The Axe was able to return to Stanford and was paraded on campus. In 1933, both schools agreed to designate the Axe as a trophy between the winner of the annual football game between the two schools. Although there have been future attempts to steal the Axe from both schools, none were successful. The Axe is still very securely guarded by both schools, and remains as a significant item in the college football world.

### 5 Dollar Bits of Broken Chair Trophy

Compared to the other two more storied trophies, the 5 Dollar Bits of Broken Chair Trophy lacks pageantry and an extensive history. However, its origin still comes from the good-natured spirit of collegiate competition. In 2014, the Twitter accounts for Minnesota mascot Goldy Gopher and a parody account of then-Nebraska head coach Bo Pelini (Faux Pelini) started banter with one another. Goldy tweeted for a wager that whichever team that scored more points would get a win. In response, Faux Pelini responded with, "OK how about if we (Nebraska) win you give me $5, if you (Minnesota) win I get to smash a wooden chair over your back".This prompted Goldy to start crowdsourcing Twitter followers and Reddit's college football community to design the "$5 Bits of Broken Chair Trophy." A real trophy was made and presented at the 2014 game. Although both fanbases approved of the trophy, both schools officially have rejected the trophy. In the 2016 game, the trophy had seemingly disappeared. However, in 2017, it was announced that the teams will play for the trophy unofficially. A new 5 Dollar Bits of Broken Chair Trophy was made and given to Minnesota, who had won that year's game.
